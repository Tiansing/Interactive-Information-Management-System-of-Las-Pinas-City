				<p>In Las Piñas, you are B.O.S.S. At least when you need to get something done at City Hall.

					The newly renovated city hall boasts of a modern and well-equipped public office dubbed “B.O.S.S” or
					the Business One-Stop Shop Center.</p>
				<p>The new Taxpayers’ Lounge looks more like a hotel lobby than a business office and is a mixture of
					efficiency and comfort. Taxpayers can sit back in plush sofas and enjoy free flowing coffee and
					juice and free Wi-Fi access. The elderly even have an express priority lane.</p>
				<p>Along physical renovation of the premises, the Las Piñas City government implemented a new system
					which simplifies and fast tracks the process of securing business permits with the:</p>
				<p>Computerization of all business transactions
					Automation of all business transactions
					Automation of the business permit and license tax system and operations of all departments and
					offices.</p>
				<p>Under the new system, applicants only need to fill up a business renewal application form, pay the
					corresponding fees at the city treasurer, and proceed to the Business Permit and Licensing Office
					for the release of permit. All the steps are located in one office so the system is faster.</p>

				<p>The city government also offers a “No requirements, No Audit” policy as long as applicants are
					willing to pay 20% higher over and above their 2010 business tax payment. Applicants for renewal of
					business permits under this policy will be given priority and provided a priority lane for faster
					processing.</p>
