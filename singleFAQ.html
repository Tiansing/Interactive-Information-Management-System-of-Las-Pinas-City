				Alabang-Zapote Road, since it’s construction in 1982, became the commercial avenue in the City. With the
				sidewalks diminished adversely, such had become a part of informal vending activities. The firms which
				had registered in the City, however, had been located in other barangays, thus do not contribute to the
				congestion of the road.
				<br>
				Business ownership accounts to about 70% single proprietors and less than a third are corporations. In
				the City, seven out of ten applications for business license are of individual or personal ownership and
				capitalization, categorized as small and medium enterprises (SME). There are less than fifty business
				partnerships and eight foreign investors.

			Las Piñas City has a road length of about 80,395.97 kilometers. City roads comprise about 92% of total roads
			while national roads are only about eight percent. Modes of public transit are buses, jeepneys, taxis and
			tricycles.
			<br>
			Besides providing internal circulation, the city provides access to adjoining cities and provinces. Las
			Piñas City’s road network heads on the north through Padre Diego Cera Avenue, Manila Coastal road and Las
			Piñas-Parañaque link road; on the south through Daang Hari road; on the east through Alabang-Zapote road;
			and on the west through P. Deigo Cera Avenue and Marcos Alvarez Avenue.
			<br>
			Alabang-Zapote Road, J. Aguilar Road and CAA Road, Padre Diego Cera Avenue formerly Quirino Avenue / Real
			St., and the newly constructed Daang Hari Road constitute the main roads of the city. The busiest and most
			congested is the Alabang-Zapote Road. This road serves as the main spine linked to various city and
			subdivision roads.
			<br>
			Naga road and Marcos Alvarez Road are the most traversed secondary roads. The emerging traffic problem
			encountered by the city has caused the opening of private subdivision roads known as the “Friendship Route”,
			as alternate routes for private vehicles. There have been 36 subdivisions, which opened up for the project.
